# Linked List API
This is a guide on how to use the linked list CRUD api

## This API provides
* Insertion
* Deletion
* Update
* Print List 
* Print in reverse
* Recursive print in reverse
* Reverse List
* Empty List 
* List deallocation / deletion

## Instructions
1. Modify Makefile according to your main program. See also Makefile's description for more details.
2. Use 'make' command to compile, link, and create the executable file.
3. Use 'make clean' command to remove object files and executable file.
3. Please read the comments for each operation in the myllist.h library that exists in the include directory
4. Initialize list before calling any CRUD operations
5. Delete the list at the end of it's use, to prevent memory leaks.
6. Enjoy.

## Ideas for the future
1. Allow storing any data type
2. Implement file stream api to store list in disk.
3. Sort list 
4. Retrieve element
5. Apply filtering or mapping 

## Disclaimer
This is by no means the perfect Linked list data structure, and we are open for any improvements, as we ourselves are also improving it day by day.
